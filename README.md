# YOLOv8 Object Detection Repository

This repository contains implementations of object detection models using YOLOv8. The project focuses on three main applications:

1. **Fire Detection**: Detects fire in images and video streams to enhance safety measures.
2. **General Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies various objects in real-time, demonstrating the versatility of YOLOv8.
3. **Drowsiness Detection**: Monitors driver alertness by detecting signs of drowsiness to prevent accidents.

Each application includes pre-trained models, inference scripts, and detailed instructions for deployment and customization.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Optimized for fast and accurate detection.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Easily deployable with included weights.
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune models for specific use cases.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for setup and usage.

## Requirements

- `ultralytics`
- `opencv-python`
